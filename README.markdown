This is my personal TextMate bundle where i put useful command and snippets.

Commands
--------

* Diff agaist saved 
  * Check if something changed in the current document
* Beautify ruby code
  * Fast way to get all indentation correct. I found this on a blog by P. Lutus and modified for TextMate by T. Burks
* Google did you mean?
  * I use this for spell checking method names, really nice and accurate
* Factory Girl Skeleton
  * In a rails application set on cursor on a model name, for example na*me, and hit Ctrl+Cmd+T and search for Factory Skeletion, this will generate code for a factory with all default column values.
